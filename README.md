## Welcome to my GitHub Pages Image Classifier

This project was inspired from a tutorial by [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A)

The image classifier is a project I built following this [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/transfer/image_classification) from tensorflow.js.  

 A lot of credit to give to the HTML template that I used.

**The template for this site came from:**   
HTML5 UP  
html5up.net | @ajlkn  
AJ
aj@lkn.io | @ajlkn

He was really helpful with directions on changing things and I highly recommend working with him.
